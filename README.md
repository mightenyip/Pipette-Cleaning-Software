# Pipette-Cleaning-Software

By Mighten Yip and Corey Landry ([Precision Biosystems Laboratory](http://pbl.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech, 2020).
Software referred to the cleaning methods as published in Bio-protocols ([source]).


This repository allows the user to reuse pipette electrodes for patch clamp experiments. This concept was explored using a Scientifica manipulator/stage and a digitally controlled [pressure control box](http://neuromaticdevices.com).

To get started: clone/fork this repository into your preferred folder location. If you do not have LabVIEW on your computer, make sure to run the setup.exe installer for the LabVIEW runtime environment. Then, run the application.exe to begin reusing your pipettes!
